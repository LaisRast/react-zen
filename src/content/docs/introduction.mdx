**Zen** is a modern, minimalist design system created by [Umami](https://umami.is).

**[@umami/react-zen](https://github.com/umami-software/react-zen)** is a React component library that represents our design system.
It is built on top of [React Aria](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/) and [Radix](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives) primitives and styled with vanilla CSS.

## Why Zen?

We wanted to create an opinionated design system that is easy to use and simple to understand.

We've taken inspiration from a lot of great projects including [React Spectrum](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-spectrum/index.html), [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/),
[shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), but our focus is more on simplicity than customization.

The goal of this project is to provide a strong foundation for building
consistent, maintainable, and accessible UI interfaces.

## The Zen way

Our focus is on improving the developer experience. These are the main principles that drive our design system:

### 1. No CSS or HTML

**&mdash; Developers should not have to write any CSS or HTML.**

This simplifies the development process to just composing tags and passing props. All design customizations
can be done via props instead of messing with CSS.

For example, this code:

```jsx
<Box padding="6" borderSize="thin" borderRadius="3" shadow="3">
  <Flexbox direction="column" alignItems="center" gap="6">
    <Heading size="4">Welcome</Heading>
    <Text type="muted" weight="mediumn">
      This is the zen way.
    </Text>
    <Button variant="primary">Enter</Button>
  </Flexbox>
</Box>
```

Produces this output:

<Example>
  <Box padding="6" borderSize="thin" borderRadius="3" shadow="3">
    <Flexbox direction="column" alignItems="center" gap="6">
      <Heading size="4">Welcome</Heading>
      <Text type="muted" weight="mediumn">{`This is the zen way.`}</Text>
      <Button variant="primary">Enter</Button>
    </Flexbox>

  </Box>
</Example>

Although all components can be styled using the standard `className` and `style` props, they should only be used in special cases.

### 2. No CSS dependencies

**&mdash; Use only vanilla CSS and CSS variables.**

This means no CSS preprocessors ([Sass](https://sass-lang.com/), [Less](https://lesscss.org/))
or frameworks ([Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), [StyleX](https://stylexjs.com/)).
Developers and contributors do not have to learn anything else besides CSS.

### 3. No arbitrary values

**&mdash; All design tokens should be defined in CSS variables.**

This enforces consistency throughout your project.

All the variables are defined [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/umami-software/react-zen/refs/heads/master/src/styles/zen.css).
