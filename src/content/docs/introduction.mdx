**Zen** is a modern, minimalist React component library created by [Umami](https://umami.is).

The components are built on top of [React Aria](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/) and [Radix](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives) primitives which provide
out-of-the-box accessibility handling. They are styled with vanilla CSS and CSS variables.

## Why Zen?

We created Zen with strong focus on the developer experience. We believe that by providing an opinionated design framework
we can make development more efficient. The goal of this project is to provide a foundation for building
consistent, maintainable, and accessible user interfaces.

Out of the box, Zen provides predefined styles that cover
[colors](/docs/design/colors),
[fonts](/docs/design/fonts),
[spacing](/docs/design/spacing),
[shadows](/docs/design/shadows),
and [borders](/docs/design/border-radius).
Also, [breakpoints](/docs/design/breakpoints) are handled natively so you can create
responsive layouts by just passing props to your components.

## Design Principles

We've taken inspiration from other great projects including [React Spectrum](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-spectrum/index.html), [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/),
[shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), but our focus is more on simplicity and ease of use
than customization. We came up with a few basic principles that we believe deliver a better development experience.

### 1. Only vanilla CSS.

There should be no overhead for learning or contributing to this library. This means no CSS preprocessors ([Sass](https://sass-lang.com/), [Less](https://lesscss.org/))
or frameworks ([Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), [StyleX](https://stylexjs.com/)), just plain CSS.

### 2. Everything defined in CSS variables.

This enforces consistency throughout your project. If you need to create your own custom components, using the
defined CSS variables ensures you end up with a consistent look and feel. Additionally, it is more maintainable
than managing CSS spread among various files.

All the variables are defined in [zen.css](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/umami-software/react-zen/refs/heads/master/src/styles/zen.css).

### 3. Comprehensive components.

Components should automatically handle all design and layout.
All design customizations can be done via props instead of manipulating CSS.
This simplifies your workflow to just composing tags and passing props.

For example, this code:

```jsx
<Box padding="6" borderSize="1" borderRadius="3" shadow="3">
  <Flexbox direction="column" alignItems="center" gap="6">
    <Heading size="4">Welcome</Heading>
    <Text type="muted" weight="medium">
      This is the zen way.
    </Text>
    <Button variant="primary">Enter</Button>
  </Flexbox>
</Box>
```

Produces this output:

<Example>
  <Box padding="6" borderSize="1" borderRadius="3" shadow="3">
    <Flexbox direction="column" alignItems="center" gap="6">
      <Heading size="4">Welcome</Heading>
      <Text type="muted" weight="medium">{`This is the zen way.`}</Text>
      <Button variant="primary">Enter</Button>
    </Flexbox>

  </Box>
</Example>

In this example we have:

- A [Box](/docs/layout/box) component that provides a styled container.
- A [Flexbox](/docs/layout/flexbox) component that aligns the content and provides spacing.
- A [Text](/docs/typography/text) component to provides styled text.
- A [Button](/docs/components/button) component for interactivity.

All components can still be styled using the standard `className` and `style` props, but they should only be used in special cases.
