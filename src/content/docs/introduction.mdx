**Zen** is a modern, minimalist React component library created by [Umami](https://umami.is).

The components are built on top of [React Aria](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/) and [Radix](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives) primitives, which provide
out-of-the-box accessibility handling, and are styled with vanilla CSS and CSS variables.

## Why Zen?

We created Zen with strong focus on the developer experience.
The goal of this project is to deliver a foundation for building consistent, maintainable, and accessible user interfaces.

### Opinionated design

Out of the box, Zen provides predefined styles that cover
[colors](/docs/design/colors),
[fonts](/docs/design/fonts),
[spacing](/docs/design/spacing),
[shadows](/docs/design/shadows),
and [borders](/docs/design/border-radius).
Additionally, [breakpoints](/docs/design/breakpoints) are handled natively so you can create
responsive layouts by just passing props to your components.

### Comprehensive components

Components automatically handle all design and layout.
All design customizations can be done via props instead of manipulating CSS.
This simplifies your workflow to just composing tags and passing props.

For example, this code:

```jsx
<Box padding="6" borderSize="1" borderRadius="3" shadow="3">
  <Flexbox direction="column" alignItems="center" gap="6">
    <Heading size="4">Welcome</Heading>
    <Text type="muted" weight="medium">
      This is the zen way.
    </Text>
    <Button variant="primary">Enter</Button>
  </Flexbox>
</Box>
```

Produces this output:

<Example>
  <Box padding="6" borderSize="1" borderRadius="3" shadow="3">
    <Flexbox direction="column" alignItems="center" gap="6">
      <Heading size="4">Welcome</Heading>
      <Text type="muted" weight="medium">{`This is the zen way.`}</Text>
      <Button variant="primary">Enter</Button>
    </Flexbox>

  </Box>
</Example>

In this example we have:

- A [Box](/docs/layout/box) component that provides a styled container.
- A [Flexbox](/docs/layout/flexbox) component that aligns the content and provides spacing.
- A [Text](/docs/typography/text) component to provides styled text.
- A [Button](/docs/components/button) component for interactivity.

All components can still be styled using the standard `className` and `style` props, but they should only be used in special cases.
