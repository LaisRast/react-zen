# Introduction

**zen** is a modern, minimalist UI component library created by [Umami](https://umami.is).

It is built on top of [React Aria](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/) and [Radix](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives) primitives
and styled with plain CSS and CSS variables.

The goal of this library is to provide a collection standard of components with consistent behavior and design.
We've taken inspiration from lots of great projects like [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/), [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/), and
[Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/).

## Styling

All components can be styled through the `className` or `style` prop.
