**zen** is a modern, minimalist UI component library created by [Umami](https://umami.is).

It is built on top of [React Aria](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/) and [Radix](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives) primitives
and styled with plain CSS and CSS variables.

We've taken inspiration from lots of great projects like [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/), [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/),
and [React Spectrum](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-spectrum/index.html) and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/).

The goal of this library is to provide a collection of rules and components that provide consistent behavior and design.

## Styling

All components can be styled through the `className` or `style` prop.
