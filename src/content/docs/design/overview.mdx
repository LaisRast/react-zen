Out of the box, Zen provides predefined styles and a collection of design tokens that cover
[colors](/docs/design/colors),
[fonts](/docs/design/fonts),
[spacing](/docs/design/spacing),
[shadows](/docs/design/shadows),
and [borders](/docs/design/border-radius).

Also, [breakpoints](/docs/design/breakpoints) are handled by the library so you can create
responsive layouts by just passing props to the components.
