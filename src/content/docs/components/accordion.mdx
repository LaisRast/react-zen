    <AccordionItem id="one">
      <div>What is supply and demand?</div>
      <div>
        Supply and demand is an economic model of price determination in a market. It states that
        the price of a good or service is determined by the quantity available (supply) and the
        desire for it (demand).
      </div>
    </AccordionItem>
    <AccordionItem id="two">
      <div>What is an algorithm?</div>
      <div>
        An algorithm is a set of well-defined instructions for performing a task or solving a
        problem.
      </div>
    </AccordionItem>
    <AccordionItem id="three">
      <div>What is the second law of thermodynamics?</div>
      <div>
        The second law of thermodynamics states that the total entropy of an isolated system can
        never decrease over time, and is often associated with the concept that natural processes
        tend to lead towards a state of greater disorder.
